- Something to increment seasons automatically (maybe) [add to pad.rs]
- Units points, points based roles, stufff like that. [WIP]
- Maybe activity level per server channel
- Maybe try FrugalOS https://dwango.github.io/articles/frugalos/
- Cache messages for generation
- I'd allow team changes on runtime but it's out of my current interests
